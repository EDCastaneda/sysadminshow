# Code for Sysadmin Show Podcast

Code for interview 30 April 2020 with Dustin Reybrouck for https://sysadminshow.com/about/.

I will attempt to explain why Python is a better choice than bash for many coding tasks.
As an exercise, I will show a bash implementation of the `head` command and how we might better write it in Python.
