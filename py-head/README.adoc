= Python implementation of `head`

In this exercise, we'll write a Python program to emulate the Unix `head` command.
If you read `man head`, you will see that this program (probably) defaults to showing the first 10 lines of a given file:

----
NAME
     head -- display first lines of a file

SYNOPSIS
     head [-n count | -c bytes] [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     This filter displays the first count lines or bytes of each of the speci-
     fied files, or of the standard input if no files are specified.  If count
     is omitted it defaults to 10.

     If more than a single file is specified, each file is preceded by a
     header consisting of the string ``==> XXX <=='' where ``XXX'' is the name
     of the file.

EXIT STATUS
     The head utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.
----

Our program will accept a `-n` or `--num` option for the number of lines to show for a _single_ file provided as a positional argument.
(We'll not implement `-c` for now.)
